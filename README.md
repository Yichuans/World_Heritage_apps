# World Heritage datasheet
This is a prototype aimed at replacing the old fashioned way of maintaining the World Hertage datasheets through Microsoft Word. Instead, it would be done entirely online and simplify the way it is published and accessed in the future.
It uses the following software/libraries: Web2py, slugify (Django utility), Bootstrap (+scrollspy), jQuery, python-markdown, bs4, codemirror.

## Currently implemented
- mobile friendly view
- affix sidebar with scroll sense and hyperlinks
- file based read and write
- deployment (AWS EC2 micro instance)
- added GA for tracking traffic
- WYSIWYG editor for updating

## Remaining implmentations
- pan-doc to convert existing datasheet in Word to Markdown
- UI polish
